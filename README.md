# Face-Mask-Detection-System-With-Alarm

### Overview
This project implements a face mask detection system with an alarm. The system utilizes a camera to capture images, processes them to detect faces, and determines whether the detected faces are wearing masks or not. If a face is detected without a mask, the system triggers an alarm to alert nearby individuals.

### Features
Real-time face detection and mask detection.
Audio- alarm triggering for faces without masks.
Easy setup and deployment.
